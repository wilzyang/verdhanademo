Olympus is paying $255.5mn for the shares in Taewoong Medical and up to $114.5mn in addition subject to the achievement of certain milestones. This works out as around \xA548.3bn in total. The nature of the milestones has not been disclosed.</p><h5 class="text-sm font-extrabold text-[#CA2420]">Expanding medical device lineup in biliary and pancreatic duct domain</h5><p class="text-black dark:text-white">Medical devices in the biliary and pancreatic duct domain comprise guidewires, balloons, stents, baskets, and sphincterotomes. Olympus is the world&#39;s leading supplier of guidewires and sphincterotomes, and also has a presence in balloons and baskets. It signed an exclusive US distribution agreement for Hanarostent metallic stents produced by South Korean company M.I.Tech in May 2018, but M.I.Tech became a subsidiary of Boston Scientific in June 2022. Olympus might have lost its supply of metallic stents if Boston Scientific had decided to sell Hanarostents itself after acquiring M.I.Tech. For its part, Taewoong Medical has been developing Pulsta transcatheter valves for use in tetralogy of Fallot (a congenital heart defect), and sells endoscopic ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA) products for use in the treatment of cancer in the US. Whereas the latter offers synergies with ultrasound endoscopes, the former is for use in structural heart defects, a domain in which Olympus has no presence.</p></div><div class="pb-5 md:pb-10"><h3 class="mb-7 text-2xl font-extrabold text-black dark:text-white sm:text-2xl">Appendix A-1</h3><h3 class="mb-3 text-base font-extrabold text-black dark:text-white sm:text-2xl">Analyst Certification </h3><p class="mb-5 text-black dark:text-white">I, Motoya Kohtani, hereby certify (1) that the views expressed in this Research report accurately reflect my personal views about any or all of the subject securities or issuers referred to in this Research report, (2) no part of my compensation was, is or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views expressed in this Research report and (3) no part of my compensation is tied to any specific investment banking transactions performed by Nomura Securities International, Inc., Nomura International plc or any other Nomura Group company.</p><h3 class="mb-3 text-base font-extrabold text-black dark:text-white sm:text-2xl">Issuer Specific Regulatory Disclosures</h3><p class="mb-5 text-black dark:text-white">The terms &quot;Nomura&quot; and &quot;Nomura Group&quot; used herein refer to Nomura Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Nomura Securities International, Inc. (&#39;NSI&#39;) and Instinet, LLC (&#39;ILLC&#39;), U. S. registered broker dealers and members of SIPC.</p><p class="text-black dark:text-white"><b>Valuation Methodology </b>We calculate our target price of \xA53,800 using a DCF model with forecasts for 10 years through 32/3 and assumptions of terminal growth of 0% and WACC of 4.4%, a risk premium of 5%, and a risk-free rate of 1%, as for all medical equipment and pharmaceutical companies under our coverage.</p><p class="text-black dark:text-white"><b>Risks that may impede the achievement of the target price</b> The first risk factor for Olympus is yen appreciation, as we calculate that every \xA51 rise against the dollar depresses annual operating profits by \xA51.1bn, with every \xA51 rise versus the euro squeezing profits by \xA50.7bn (Olympus has the highest forex sensitivity of Japanese medical equipment manufacturers). Second, in the matter involving Olympus&#39;s duodenoscopes, settlements to resolve civil claims could be much larger than we anticipate. Third, there is a risk of weak sales of new products, including EVIS X1 GI endoscopes, 4K surgical endoscopy systems, and Thunderbeat devices. Fourth, there is a risk of failure in development of major new products in the TSD business, particularly iTIND and single-use GI endoscopes. Fifth, regarding the alleged bribery case in China, if bribery were found to have taken place, Olympus would probably be subject to a fine and investors would have reason to lose confidence in the company once again.</p></div><div class="pb-5 md:pb-20"><h5 class="text-lg font-bold text-black">Materially mentioned issuers</h5><div class="pb-5 relative overflow-auto"><table class="border-collapse table-auto w-full text-sm"><thead><tr><th class="border px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black">Issuer</th><th class="border px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black">Ticker</th><th class="border px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black">Price</th><th class="border px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black">Price date</th><th class="border px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black">Stock rating</th><th class="border px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black">Sector rating</th><th class="border px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black">Disclosures</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="border border-black px-4 py-2 text-black font-medium">Olympus</td><td class="border border-black px-4 py-2 text-black font-medium">XXXXX </td><td class="border border-black px-4 py-2 text-black font-medium">IDR 13,800.0</td><td class="border border-black px-4 py-2 text-black font-medium">24-Feb-2023 </td><td class="border border-black px-4 py-2 text-black font-medium">Buy </td><td class="border border-black px-4 py-2 text-black font-medium">N/A </td><td class="border border-black px-4 py-2 text-black font-medium">A4,A5,A6,A11</td></tr></tbody></table></div><table class="table-auto"><tbody><tr><td class="pr-2 py-2 text-black font-medium">A4</td><td class="py-2 text-black font-medium"><p>The Nomura Group has had an investment banking services client relationship with the subject company during the past 12 months.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="pr-2 py-2 text-black font-medium">A5</td><td class="py-2 text-black font-medium"><p>The Nomura Group has received compensation for investment banking services from the subject company in the past 12 months.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="pr-2 py-2 text-black font-medium">A6</td><td class="py-2 text-black font-medium"><p>The Nomura Group expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from the subject company in the next three months.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="pr-2 py-2 text-black font-medium">A11</td><td class="py-2 text-black font-medium"><p>The Nomura Group beneficially owns 1% or more of a class of common equity securities of the subject company.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="pb-5 md:pb-20"><h3 class="mb-3 text-base font-extrabold text-black dark:text-white sm:text-2xl">Important Disclosures</h3><p class="mb-5 text-black dark:text-white">The lists of issuers that are affiliates or subsidiaries of Nomura Holdings Inc., the parent company of Nomura Securities Co., Ltd., issuers that have officers who concurrently serve as officers of Nomura Securities Co., Ltd., issuers in which the Nomura Group holds 1% or more of any class of common equity securities and issuers for which Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. has lead managed a public offering of equity or equity linked securities in the past 12 months are available at https://www.nomuraholdings.com/report/ .
